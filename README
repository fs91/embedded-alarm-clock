PI IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS

pi_reg takes two message types
MY_WEEK -> SENDS THE ENTIRE SCHEDULE IN THE W+ FORMAT
W+myclass1|... -> ACCEPTS THE ENTIRE SCHEDULE
	       So when you add or delete send the entire schedule back with the change being made
	       This makes it easier and quicker on the pi
	       
pi_reg now when accpets the entire message back saves two files
schedule.txt -> saves schedule in easy to msg format
cron.alarm -> crontab file for schedulin

Motion detection is done and working in python and called when schedule with cronjobs.
